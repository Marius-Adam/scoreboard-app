## Description

I built this scoreboard app as part of the Treehouse Learn React Track. This course helped me build a base knowlege about React. I covered things like: JSX, Props, State, Components, Events and eventually built this scoreboard-app as a final project to validade what I learned.

## Functionality

<ul>
  <li>Simple application to track multiple players and their scores for a game</li>
  <li>Stopwatch function with reset</li>
  <li>Add & Remove players</li>
  <li>View individual player scores along with total number of players and total score</li>
</ul>

## To do

- [ ] Refactor code to React 16.9
- [ ] Add a crown to player with most points
